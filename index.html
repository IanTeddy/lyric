                <p><span class=rain>Rain</span>, <span class="intro">he wanted it comfortable<br>
                    I wanted that pain<br>
                    He wanted a bride<br>
                    I was making my own name. Chasing that fame<br>
                    He stayed the same<br>
                    All of me changed like midnight</span><br>
                    <br>
                    My town was a wasteland.<br>
                    Full of cages, full of fences, pageant queens and big pretenders<br>
                    But for some, it was paradise<br>
                    My boy was a montage<br>
                    A slow-motion, love potion, jumping off things in the ocean<br>
                    I broke his heart 'cause he was nice<br>
                    <span class="him emphasis">He was sunshine</span> <br>
                    <span class="her emphasis">I was midnight rain</span><br>
                    He wanted it <span class="him-sub">comfortable</span><br>
                    I wanted that  <span class="her-sub">pain</span><br>
                    He wanted a <span class="him-sub">bride</span><br>
                    I was making <span class="her-sub">my own name</span><br>
                    Chasing that <span class="her-sub">fame</span><br>
                    He stayed the same<br>
                    All of me changed like <span class=mid-rain>midnight</span><br>
                    <br>
                    It came like a postcard<br>
                    Picture perfect, shiny family, holiday, peppermint candy<br>
                    But for him it's every day<br>
                    So I peered through a window<br>
                    A deep portal, time travel, all the love we unravel<br>
                    And the life I gave away<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="him">'Cause he was sunshine</span> <br>
                    <span class="her">I was midnight rain</span><br>
                    He wanted it <span class="him-sub">comfortable</span><br>
                    I wanted that  <span class="her-sub">pain</span><br>
                    He wanted a <span class="him-sub">bride</span><br>
                    I was making <span class="her-sub">my own name</span><br>
                    Chasing that <span class="her-sub">fame</span><br>
                    He stayed the same<br>
                    All of me changed like <span class=mid-rain>midnight</span><br>
                    <br>
                    Rain, he wanted it <span class="him-sub">comfortable</span><br>
                    I wanted that  <span class="her-sub">pain</span><br>
                    He wanted a <span class="him-sub">bride</span><br>
                    I was making <span class="her-sub">my own name</span><br>
                    Chasing that <span class="her-sub">fame</span><br>
                    He stayed the same<br>
                    All of me changed<br>
                    Like midnight<br>
                    I guess sometimes we all get<br>
                    Just what we wanted, just what we wanted, and <br>
                    <span class="strong">He never thinks of me</span><br>
                    Except when I'm on TV<br>
                    I guess sometimes we all get<br>
                    Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted, and <br>
                    <span class="strong">I never think of him</span><br>
                    Except on midnights like this (midnights like this)<br>
